# Hello World

This is probably the simplest possible Tact program. It will provide callers with the classic output "hello world".

Tact lets you write smart contracts. This code defines a single contract named `HelloWorld`. Smart contracts must be deployed on-chain to be usable, try to deploy this contract by pressing the <span class="mdButton blue">Deploy</span> button.

## A simple interaction

Contracts can have _getters_ like `greeting()`. These are special functions that allow users to query information from the contract. Try to call the getter by pressing the <span class="mdButton teal">Get greeting</span> button.
